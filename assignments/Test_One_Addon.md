**Multi-tasking**-The ability for an OS to run more than one process simultaneously, while still having control over the CPU and other resources at the same time.
*Example of multi-tasking*: When the user opens an internet browser and a word document at the same time, it can keep up with where both applications are "simultaneously" (it's not truely simltaneous, but the processer is working faster than humans can notice).

**Multi-programming**-Several programs are run at the same time on a processor. While it is not truely simltaneous, it appears to be because the processer works so fast.
*Example of multi-programming*: When a user is listening to music while scanning their computer with their anti-virus software. The CPU is playing music while scanning the computer at the same time.

**Multi-processing**-The coordinated processing of programs between multiple processors.
*Example of multi-processing*:A multi-core processer managing multiple networks on different cores and processing information coming from the networks (such as a server with multiple networks).

**Multi-threaded**-The ability of a single core (or in a uni-core system the main core) to execute multiple threads (which are processes broken down into smaller, simpilar tasks) concurrently, which is supported by the OS.
*Example of multi-threading*:When the OS breaks down a process into threads and keeps track of all of the different threads and how far along the threads are in their execution.
